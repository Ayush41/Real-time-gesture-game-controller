# Real-Time Gesture Game Controller

## Overview

The Real-Time Gesture Game Controller is a Python-based project that allows you to control games using hand gestures. By leveraging powerful libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pynput, this controller translates real-time hand movements into game controls, offering a novel and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Uses Mediapipe for accurate hand gesture detection and tracking.
- **Intuitive Game Control**: Implements game controls through hand gestures using Pynput.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual feedback of detected gestures through OpenCV.
- **Enhanced Gaming Experience**: Offers a hands-free gaming experience by translating gestures into commands.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and visual feedback.
- **Mediapipe**: For hand gesture recognition.
- **Pynput**: For controlling game inputs.
- **TFX**: For TensorFlow extended support (if applicable).

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
https://github.com/Ayush41/Real-time-gesture-game-controller.git
cd Real-time-gesture-game-controller
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pynput tfx
